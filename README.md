### Project Title:<br>
Probabilistic structural health monitoring of composite structures under impact testing <br>

### Project Description:<br> 
The aerospace industry's safety and cost concerns drive the investigation of damage detection and progression in carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) from low-energy impacts. Leveraging machine learning, specifically Auto-Regressive models, offers a promising avenue for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). By tailoring these models to the unique characteristics of composite materials and impact-induced damage, the aim is to enhance safety and reduce maintenance costs. This project aims to develop efficient detection techniques. <br>
